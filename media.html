            <p>TWRFU prides in marketing wheelchair rugby at both national and international level through Main
                Stream Media (Television and Radio), Social Media and Print Media. We have had our activities
                such as training of coaches and training sessions for athletes covered by media houses such as
                NTV, UBC, Excel TV and Monitor. We have been hosted several times on Excel TV to talk issues
                concerning wheelchair rugby and as result the public has been introduced to the game.
                And mostly people living with disability encouraged to join Para Sport especially the most
                vulnerable such as victims of Spinal Cord Injury We share with the public our activities
                regarding wheelchair rugby on our Facebook page (The Uganda Wheelchair Rugby Foundation).

                Uganda and what the foundation is doing to improve lives of people living with disability in the
